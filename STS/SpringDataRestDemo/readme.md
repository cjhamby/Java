# Spring Data Rest Demo

In Spring, there is an easy way to create REST APIs which are linked to Repositories.  This is done with the <b>Rest Repositories</b> dependency.

This project creates an API at the following link:  <i>localhost:8080/api</i>

The API can be explored easily using Postman, by making a GET request to the above link.  
It supports additional methods, including POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE requests.
